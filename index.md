I am a **Data Scientist** and **PhD** in **High Energy Physics**. For almost 15 years I used
machine learning to investigate the nature of fundamental interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

Currently, I help industrial clients in their **digital transformation** journey.

**I like working with** all sorts of **data**: text, images, graphs, time series...
In this blog I collect my experiments in applying machine learning algorithms to these datasets.  

If you want to reach out, please contact me on twitter or linkedin.

Enjoy the reading!
